    Creating your own / modifying / overriding the templates
    
    You can let projects have their own templates by copying the "template_js"
    folder into your sketch folder. Edit the contents of applet.html as you
    want but do not rename files. Every word that starts and ends with double
    at-signs like "@@sketch@@" are placeholders for values being inserted
    on export.
    
    Any additional files inside "template_js" are copied along.
    
===============================================================================
    
    Updating to the latest Processing.js by hand
    
    Just replace the "template_js/processing.js" with the latest from:
    
    http://processingjs.org/download
    
    Make sure to keep the name "processing.js", let me know if you find
    anything that does not work anymore and used to work with earlier
    versions.
